# Northcoders News API

## Local setup

To run this project locally, create two .env files in the root directory: `.env.development` and `.env.test`

They each require a `PGDATABASE=` key with a different database name as the value in each file:

#### .env.development

`PGDATABASE=nc_news`

#### .env.test

`PGDATABASE=nc_news_test`

To install all dependencies run `npm install` before running the app.
